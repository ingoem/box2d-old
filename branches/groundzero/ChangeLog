- Renamed ./Source to ./Box2D (fixing cross platform #include problems).
- Removed relative includes in all header files.
- Moved ./Contrib/glui and ./Contrib/glut to ./Examples/TestBed/Contrib/*.
- Merged kavaler's makefiles with my own and removed the creation of the ./Gen
directory. Objects are now generated next to their source files since this
decreases the complexity of the Makefile's greatly (thanks kavaler).
- Added a CMake alternative build to the svn which is currently experimental.
- Minor code maintenence (comments, bad casts).

TestBed changes:
- Examples/TestBed/Source/TestEntries.h no longer defines all the different
projects, edit Examples/TestBed/Source/TestEntries.cpp for this (more
flexibility, less stupid bug-prone).

! Visual Studio 2005/XCode and Iphone building is definitely broken.
